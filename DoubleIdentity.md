Claurice sat at a small table across from a bearded man by the name of Caine, with dirty dinner plates in front of both of them.
"Thank you for the meal, sorry that I couldn't help out," said Claurice, brushing her messy, brown hair away from her face.
Caine smiled, "Don't sweat it, I know you've been worrying a lot."
Claurice looked down at her plate and picked up her dessert, a raspberry cupcake.
"I've been sweating that much, huh?" she said.
"Relax, they won't get rid of you, you're too important," he said.
She examined her raspberry cupcake from all angles.
"I don't know about that. They don't need me," she said.
Caine reached over, plucked the cupcake out of her hands, now all lumpy from her fidgeting, and held her hands in his.
"You're important to me," he said.
Claurice smiled. His large hands reassured her.
"You are to me too," she said back.
"In that case, I have something to ask of you," said Caine. He reached into his pocket with one hand, the other still holding onto Claurice.
Mabelle blinked. Someone was holding her hand. Her eyes followed it from the wrist, up the arm, to his bearded face. She recognized this bearded man. Claurice had been seeing him for a few months now.
"Claurice?" the man asked. His searching eyes never left her face. "Can I put it on?"
Mabelle looked down. A golden ring glinted near her hand. Mabelle pulled away from the man's grip. It felt too restrictive.
His eyes finally fell away.
"Oh, I, I see," he said. He tucked the ring away in his pocket.
"I'd like to go home now," said Mabelle.
"A-alright. I'll call a cab for you."
"Ma'am? Ma'am, we're here."
Claurice opened her eyes. She was in a car, no, a cab. She yawned and opened up her purse.
"How much do I owe you?" asked Claurice, pulling out her wallet.
"No no," said the driver. "Already paid for."
Claurice froze.
"Who by?" she asked the driver.
The driver turned around to look at her and said, "The man you were with. You don't remember?"
"No... no I don't," said Claurice. She put away her wallet and pondered for a moment.
"Well, um, thank you," she told the driver, and exited the taxi. She watched the yellow taxi drive away under the golden street lights, honking at crossing pedestrians. The quizzical expression on her face slid away to one of horror. She looked at her pale, clean hands. Nothing. She pulled open her purse and rummaged through every compartment. Cellphone, wallet, hand sanitizer, tissues. No ring.
Claurice looked around her. She was outside her studio apartment. She dashed inside, ran straight into the bathroom, and yanked the medicine cabinet open. A few bottles fell from the top shelves, clattering onto the bathroom counter and rolling to the ground. She grabbed a transparent, brown bottle on the bottom shelf, and poured its contents on the bathroom counter. Hordes of white pills showered out, chattering as they hit the stone counter.
With shaking hands, Claurice began to sort through them.
"One, two," she counted, and moved the pills to one side until they all formed a tight cluster.
"Forty seven, forty eight. Forty eight."
She picked up the brown bottle and read the label again.
"Prescribed to Claurice Tenum 50 capsules Directions: Take two at night before bedtime," it listed, along with side effects, warnings, and ingredients.
Claurice threw the empty bottle at the mirror. It bounced back and scuttled away.
Her reflection stared back at Claurice with teary eyes.
"I hate you!" she shouted at her. "You took them!"
Claurice stormed out of the bathroom towards her desk tucked away in the corner. She yanked open a drawer filled to the brim with printed paper. She took the one on top and ripped it four times over, screaming as she did so. She took the next one and tore it too shreds, then the next, and the next, until the drawer had nothing to offer for her distress, so she opened the next one and tore through that too. Paper bits snowed about her, fluttering to the ground where they mingled with her tear drops.
The cheap curtains glowed, letting in ambient sunlight into the studio. A tiny beam of light trickled its way down from the white walls to the bed where Mabelle hid under a nest of thick blankets.
The phone on the bedside stand buzzed. A hand wandered out of the cave of warmth and answered the phone.
"Hello?" Mabelle managed to murmur. "Oh hey Ken. Yeah I read it. Go ahead, todays Saturday, I'm always free on weekends. Yes, I still want you to cut them. Look, they don't further the plot or serve any other purpose. Unless you can come up with a good reason they're necessary, cut or combine them. You have too many characters. Page thirty two, paragraph three? Give me a moment."
Mabelle flung off her blankets, stood up, and reached her arms up to stretch them out, but froze. The drawers of her desks all hung open like mouths agape in shock. A mess of paper shreds littered desk and floor.
"Ken I'll call you back," Mabelle hung up the phone. She knelt down and examined one of the paper bits. Twelve point font spoke in fragments on one side.
Mabelle gritted her teeth. All her manuscripts had been torn. She walked over to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet. An assortment of different sized bottles lined the shelves. But one was missing, one transparent, brown bottle evaded her.
Someone was in her bathroom. Claurice decided to find out who.
Mabelle slammed the cabinet shut and caught movement in the mirror. She turned around to see Claurice in the doorway.
They glared at each other for a while until one spoke.
"Get out of here," she snarled.
"No. This is my home. You get out."
"Me? You don't belong here."
"Of course I belong here."
"You don't belong anywhere."
Claurice stretched out an arm. In her hand, she held a transparent, brown bottle.
"Is this what you're looking for?" asked Claurice.
"Give that back, that's mine!" shouted Mabelle.
"Yours? How can you lie like that, it's prescribed to me," said Claurice.
"For to you? It's to get rid of you!" Mabelle opened the medicine cabinet again, and chucked a bottle at Claurice. Claurice ducked and the bottle flew over her head.
"That was to get rid of you too!" shouted Mabelle. She aimed another one at Claurice's head. "And this one! And this one!"
Claurice cowered on the ground, still clutching the brown bottle, her arms raised to shield her from the medicine bottles and Mabelle's hysterical screaming. Mabelle kept pelting Claurice until both the cabinet and her words ran out. Claurice lowered her hands and peeked up at Mabelle with terrified eyes.
Mabelle grabbed the ceramic cup she kept her toothbrush in and threw it at that disgusting face. The cup hit Claurice above her right eye and shattered into thick shards, knocking her over. A jolt of pain cracked her head, blood streaming into her eye. Claurice screamed, and held a hand to her wound. The transparent, brown bottle slipped away from her grasp.
A sudden, sharp pain erupted on Mabelle's forehead. She raised a hand to it to stifle her headache. She took a few steps to Claurice, who lay on the ground sobbing.
"I'm real!" Mabelle screamed at the pathetic figure on the ground. "You're not! This is your home?! Yeah right, you're pathetic!"
Mabelle knelt over Claurice, and wrapped her fingers over Claurice's neck.
"I pay the rent. I do the work. I finish the job," said Mabelle. Claurice tried to pry away Mabelle's fingers, but she already felt light headed.
"What do you do?" asked Mabelle. "All you do is flirt with men and waste time with friends. Friends you don't even trust! As if I'm some dirty little secret. But it's you, you're the-"
Mabelle coughed. She didn't have the breath to finish her thoughts. Her hands fell away from Claurice's reddened neck. Claurice pushed her off and rolled away, coughing and hacking.
Both of them lay on the ground catching their breath, not looking at each other.
Claurice spotted the glint of cheap plastic. She crawled over to the transparent, brown bottle.
The label read, "Prescribed to Mabelle Tenum."
Claurice glanced over at Mabelle. She was on all fours heaving for air, tears and blood covering her grotesque face, snot dripping from her nose. Claurice looked around the studio. The messy bed. The desk with scraps of paper. The empty kitchen, the bathroom they were just in.
Claurice read the label again.
"Mabelle Tenum."
The phone buzzed. Its screen lit up, providing the only source of light in the studio.
Mabelle woke up to find her face rested against the carpeted floor. She got up, but the world started to spin, so she sat back down and waited for it to pass. The phone stopped its cacophony and returned the studio to darkness. Mabelle traced her hand along the wall and found the light switch.
Blood caked her formerly beige carpet. Her bed was made, and her desk was clear of any paper except for a single yellow note attached to a transparent, brown bottle. Mabelle took off the note and read the very neat handwriting.
"I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore."
Mabelle opened the drawers to find a pen to write her own note back. A stack of tattered manuscripts stitched together with tape filled the drawers. Mabelle chuckled to herself. She looked back at that brown bottle on her desk. It was the fourteenth to bring the promise of a simpler life. Mabelle picked up a manuscript and began to read. The words were slightly misaligned as if a paperquake cracked the paper and shifted the words away. As Mabelle read, her smile grew. The words did not flow, but still managed to make it to their destination. Mabelle's smile blossomed, and she set down the manuscript to laugh. She put a hand on the desk to stabilize herself and laughed some more.
The incandescent light bulb that lit the studio turned off, but the room was still illuminated. Claurice got out of bed as if it were any other morning, with a refreshing stretch and a hesitating shuffle to the bathroom. She turned on the faucet to wash her face, but the water stung, turning off autopilot. Claurice examined the dark red cut over her eye in the mirror. She found herself gazing at her reflection. Her reflection gazed back, because that's how mirrors work. She brought her hands to her face, and poked and prodded it, feeling the weight of her fingers. She winced when she poked her wound. She was awake.
Curious, Claurice opened the medicine cabinet. Only a single yellow note greeted her, the rest having all moved on with their lives.
"Today is Sunday. You can have it. Have fun," read the note.
Claurice took the note in her hands and read it again. The words were written in bold strokes, each letter carrying life within them.
Her phone buzzed, back on her desk in the studio room. Claurice rushed over to pick it up in time, but paused when she read the caller ID.
"Caine Sergev," revealed the phone.
Claurice picked up the phone, and her thumb hovered over the green, answer icon. The phone buzzed a couple more times then stopped. Claurice turned off the phone. She looked at her other hand, which still held the note. After reading it once more, she changed into her day clothes and went outside for a walk.
